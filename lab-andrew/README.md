## Getting Started

To get started using this application, familiarity with node and npm, as well as git is assumed. Fork/clone this repo to your machine, and do an `npm i`. Also navigate to the backend folder and do the same. To view on localhost in your browser, start the server by typing `npm run start` into the terminal. Then navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser. To have friends join, simply have them join your IP address, at port 3000.
